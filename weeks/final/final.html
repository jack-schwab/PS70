Ah, we've finally made it.
For my final project, I made, what some are calling, the greatest game since hide and seek.
I am far too humble to ever consider my creation to be the greatest game since hide and seek.
The greatest game since tag?  Now that's a comparison I am on board with.
</p>

<p>
Alright, let's cut to the chase.
If you have been keeping up, my final project idea started as a self-contained portable charger.
This would work by hand cranking a motor and storing the power in a battery.
I needed to find a way to gamify this, however.
The game?  Fishing Adventure.
</p>

Have you ever been out fishing and you finally get a bite?
But what now?  You have no idea how many cranks it will take to reel that fish in!
That is what the team here at Fishing Adventure set out to solve.
No longer will you have to just crank and hope.
Our proprietary technology tells the user <i>exactly</i> how many cranks it will take to catch a virtual fish.

<p>
Allow me to demonstrate:

    </video>
</p>

<p>
The game was coded with simple HTML and Javascript.
I tried experimenting with a few Javascript packages to make it look better, but that will be a hill I will have to climb another time.
The ESP32 communicated with the web game through WebSockets, an Arduino package.

I never got around to the power storage part of the project, which, is a bit sad considering that was the whole point.
Well, Julius H. Comroe Jr. said it best: "Serendipity is looking in a haystack for a needle and discovering a farmer's daughter."
</p>

<p>
Trust me when I say I will be back.
I will not stop until every child in America has a 3D printed virtual fishing crank in their hands or until I find a way to store the power I generate from turning the motor, whichever comes first.
