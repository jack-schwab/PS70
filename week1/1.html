<p>
My first final project idea is to create a desktop hydroponics system.
Hydroponics is a form of farming that uses nutrient rich water rather than soil.
Some forms of hydroponics have fish live inside the water to give it nutrients.
Essentially, I will make a self-sustaining fish tank that grows plants on top.

# idea two

    <pre style="color:gray">
# ---------------------------------

<p>
My second final project idea is to create a sensor to go inside of a tennis racket handle.
Similar to the knife handle sensor we were shown in class or Nick's pistol grip sensor, the tennisensor will also have the goal of giving the user data to improve their performance.
One important technique in tennis is to hit the ball in the center of the racket head: the "sweet spot".
My goal is for the tennisensor to help you hit the ball in the sweet spot every time.

# ---------------------------------

<p>
My third final project idea is to create a "smart" water bottle.
Primarily, one with self-cleaning capabilities by way of UV light.
Even better if I can make an universal attachment to clean (most) water bottles.
