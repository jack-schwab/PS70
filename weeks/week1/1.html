# the three ideas

<p>
  <li>
    One: My first final project idea is to create a desktop aquaponics system.
    Hydroponics is a form of farming that uses nutrient rich water rather than soil.
    Aquaculture is raising fish.
    Aquaponics is a combination of these two practices: the fish's waste adds nutrients to the water and the plants purify the water.
    Essentially, I will make a self-sustaining (semi-closed system) fish tank that grows plants on top.
  </li>
</p>

    Two: My second final project idea is to create a sensor to go inside of a tennis racket handle.
    Similar to the knife handle sensor we were shown in class or Nick's pistol grip sensor, the tenniSensor will also have the goal of giving the user data to improve their performance.
    One important technique in tennis is to hit the ball in the center of the racket head: the "sweet spot".
    My goal is for the tenniSensor to help you hit the ball in the sweet spot every time.
  </li>
</p>
<p>
  <li>
    Three: My third final project idea is to create a "smart" water bottle.
    Primarily, one with self-cleaning capabilities by way of UV light.
    Even better if I can make a universal attachment to clean (most) water bottles.
  </li>

# the idea

# ---------------------------------

  <p>
The inspiration for my idea came from my work in another class, LPCE 10: StudioLab on Creativity and Entrepreneurship."
In that class, my group is making a mock venture for a self-powered battery, primarily for phone charging applications (a power bank).
  </p>
  <p>
I wanted that to be my project, but, as Bobby informed me, the "forever flashlight" technology (a magnet and copper coil) is not strong enough to power a microcontroller while having enough power leftover to store.
So we brainstormed for a bit and landed on a hand crank powered charger that I will try to gamify.
The interactive ideas that sprung out were using relays to, say, turn off your TV if you are not cranking hard/fast enough.
Or, connecting it to a fishing web game to make use of the cranking aspect.
  </p>
  <p>
This project will require finding a way to track the amount of rotations I complete with the hand crank.
Since the crank will be attached to a motor, for the power storage aspect, I could use an encoder to track the motor rotations.
Or, I could put a magnet on the hand crank and Hall effect sensor in a fixed position and track how many times the magnet passes by the sensor.
