Fall 2024 PS70 had a unique machine building week.
You see, someone clogged the Science Center toilet, and we had to fix it.
</p>

<p>
SC102 had an ultra-convenient bathroom... for about a week.
The pipes got clogged thanks to, I'm assuming, Nick Ige.
The Science Center's maintenance team was ready to blow $10,000 on a pipe inspection robot to locate the clog, so they can drill and clear it.
That is, until Nathan stepped in.
</p>

<p>
The upshot: our class tried to build a pipe inspection robot.
Unfortunately, I do not have any pictures of it.
More unfortunately, the pipe robot never made its way down the tubes... yet!
</p>

<p>
My contribution to the whole project was to research ways to locate the robot once it went into the abyss.
This sounds easy, until you realize it will be encased by a thick steel pipe under lots of concrete and Earth.
There were two leading ideas: encoders to track the motor steps or TX/RX wireless communication.
</p>

<p>
Evan Jolley and I were on the TX/RX Team.
Our catchphrase was "Beat the Crete", thus we both eventually became known as "Team Crete."
We poured blood, sweat, and tears into our research, and I now consider Evan a brother to me.
