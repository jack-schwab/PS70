Ah, we've finally made it.
For my final project, I made, what some are calling, the greatest game since hide and seek.
I am far too humble to ever consider my creation to be the greatest game since hide and seek.
The greatest game since tag?  Now that's a comparison I am on board with.
</p>

<p>
Alright, let's cut to the chase.
If you have been keeping up, my final project idea started as a self-contained portable charger.
This would work by hand cranking a motor and storing the power in a battery.
I needed to find a way to gamify this, however.
The game?  Fishing Adventure.

Have you ever been out fishing and you finally get a bite?
But what now?  You have no idea how many cranks it will take to reel that fish in.
That is what the team here at Fishing Adventure set out to solve.
No longer will you have to just crank and hope.
Our proprietary technology tells the user <i>exactly</i> how many cranks it will take to catch a virtual fish.
