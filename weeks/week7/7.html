My Minimum Viable Product was an extension of last week's assignment.
I mounted a Hall effect sensor on a DC Motor and a magnet on a 3D printed crank arm that attached to the motor such that when the user rotated the crank arm, the magnet passes the sensor once per rotation and this was tracked by an Arduino script.
It was "gamified" through my partnership with Jim.
We combined our MVPs such that each crank played 1 second of music from a German radio stream.
That way, you need to crank constantly to listen to music.
