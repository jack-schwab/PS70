# ---------------------------------

    <p>
    I've been lucky to grow up in Honolulu, Hawaii in between two brothers, a military father, and flight attendant mother.
    </p>

    <p>
    I love comedy, writing, music, sports, and community service.
    </p>

    <p>
    On campus, I am a member of Army ROTC, Engineers Without Borders, WHRB, and a former Varsity sailor.

      <p>
      One: My first final project idea is to create a desktop hydroponics system.
      Hydroponics is a form of farming that uses nutrient rich water rather than soil.
      Some forms of hydroponics have fish live inside the water to give it nutrients.
      Essentially, I will make a self-sustaining fish tank that grows plants on top.
      </p>

      <p>
      Two: My second final project idea is to create a sensor to go inside of a tennis racket handle.
      Similar to the knife handle sensor we were shown in class or Nick's pistol grip sensor, the tennisensor will also have the goal of giving the user data to improve their performance.
      One important technique in tennis is to hit the ball in the center of the racket head: the "sweet spot".
      My goal is for the tennisensor to help you hit the ball in the sweet spot every time.
      </p>

      <p>
      Three: My third final project idea is to create a "smart" water bottle.
      Primarily, one with self-cleaning capabilities by way of UV light.
      Even better if I can make an universal attachment to clean (most) water bottles.

This web-design was adopted by that of <a href="https://manas-kulkarnii.github.io/PS70/">manas kulkarni</a>.  Here's what he had to say:
<p>
"this website is largely adapted from the ps70 documentation website created by <a href="https://ingenuitive.github.io/PHYSCI-70/">kalos chu</a>. additionally, it draws inspiration from <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com">paul graham</a>'s personal website. when asked why he wastes screen space by making the text on his site so narrow, he answers, 'the aim of web design is not to use all available screen space. it is legibility. text is most legible with no more than 70 characters per line.'"
